                        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2 leading-relaxed">
                            The first step in the buying process is searching for homes. Determine your preferences, such as location, size, and amenities, and use online resources to explore available properties. It's also a good idea to work with a real estate agent to help narrow down the search based on your criteria.

                        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2 leading-relaxed">
                            Before making an offer, it's essential to get pre-approved for a mortgage. This step will help you understand how much you can afford and show sellers that you're a serious buyer. Work with a lender to gather the necessary documents and get pre-approval based on your financial profile.

                            Once you've found a home you like, it's time to make an offer. Your real estate agent will help you determine a competitive price based on market conditions. Be prepared for negotiations, as sellers may counter your offer or request changes.

                            After your offer is accepted, schedule a home inspection. This is a crucial step to ensure the property is in good condition. If the inspector finds any issues, you may need to negotiate repairs or price adjustments before proceeding.
