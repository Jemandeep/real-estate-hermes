                            When buying a home, it's easy to focus solely on the purchase price. However, there are additional expenses you need to account for before finalizing the deal. These are called closing costs and can include various fees such as appraisal fees, title insurance, and other charges that aren't part of the home price but are essential for the transaction to be completed. Understanding these costs is critical in preparing your budget and avoiding surprises at the closing table.

                            Closing costs are the fees and expenses you’ll need to pay to finalize the home-buying process. They typically include a variety of charges, many of which are paid at the closing of the transaction, when ownership of the property is officially transferred. These costs can range from 2% to 5% of the home purchase price, depending on the location and type of loan you're using.

                            <li><strong>Appraisal Fees:</strong> An appraisal is required to determine the value of the property. This helps lenders ensure the home is worth the loan amount.</li>

                            <li><strong>Attorney Fees:</strong> In some states, an attorney is required to oversee the closing process and ensure all legal documents are in order.</li>
                            <li><strong>Loan Origination Fees:</strong> The lender may charge a fee for processing the loan application, which is typically a percentage of the loan amount.</li>
                            <li><strong>Escrow Fees:</strong> If you're using an escrow service, they may charge a fee to hold the funds during the closing process.</li>
                            <li><strong>Prepaid Property Taxes and Insurance:</strong> Depending on your lender, you may need to pay a portion of your property taxes and insurance upfront.</li>
                            <li><strong>Recording Fees:</strong> These fees are charged by local government agencies to record the transaction and officially transfer the property title.</li>
