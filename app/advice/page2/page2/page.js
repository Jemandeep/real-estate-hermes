                            Before you start house hunting, it's crucial to get pre-approved for a mortgage. A pre-approval helps you understand how much you can borrow, making your home search more focused and efficient. It also shows sellers that you're a serious buyer, which can give you a competitive edge.

                        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2 leading-relaxed">
                            A mortgage pre-approval is a process where a lender evaluates your financial situation and determines how much money they are willing to lend you. Unlike pre-qualification, which gives you a general idea of what you may be able to borrow, pre-approval is more thorough and involves a detailed review of your finances, including your credit score, income, debt, and assets.

                            To get pre-approved for a mortgage, youâ€™ll need to provide various documents to the lender, including:
                            <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mt-2">
                                <li>Proof of income (pay stubs, tax returns, etc.)</li>
                                <li>Proof of assets (bank statements, retirement accounts)</li>
                                <li>Credit history (the lender will run a credit check)</li>
                                <li>Employment details (current job, length of employment)</li>
                            </ul>
                            Once the lender reviews these documents, they will determine the loan amount you qualify for.
