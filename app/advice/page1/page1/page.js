                    <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2 leading-relaxed">
                        For many, the ability to have a quiet, functional workspace at home is now a must. This has led to a surge in demand for homes with dedicated office spaces.

                    <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2 leading-relaxed">
                        Fast and reliable internet is no longer a luxury but a necessity. Remote workers rely heavily on video conferencing, file sharing, and cloud-based tools, making high-speed internet a top priority when choosing a home. Areas with poor connectivity are now less desirable for remote-working professionals.
